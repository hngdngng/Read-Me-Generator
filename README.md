  ## Description 
  Read-Me-Generator is a simple command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md and LICENSE.md following standard template and formatting. The application uses Node.js to get user input from a series of prompts using the Inquirer package. User inputs are then placed accordingly into an easy-to-follow README.md, and LICENSE.md file.
